# LLMcalc — LLM Infrastructure Calculator

> A precision-first, fully client-side tool for estimating GPU memory, throughput, latency, and cloud costs for any LLM workload.

Built for ML engineers, infrastructure architects, and developers who need accurate hardware estimates — not ballpark guesses.

---

## What it does

LLMcalc answers the questions you actually have before deploying or training a large language model:

- **How much VRAM does this model need?** — broken down by weights, KV cache, activations, gradients, and optimizer states
- **Which GPU can run it?** — ranked by tier (Budget / Balanced / Performance) with utilization bars
- **What will it cost on cloud?** — sortable table across AWS, Azure, GCP, Lambda, RunPod, Vast, CoreWeave, Together AI
- **How fast will it run?** — tokens/sec estimate using the roofline model, with prefill/decode breakdown
- **What's the cheapest option per million tokens?** — cost efficiency metric computed automatically
- **How many concurrent users can it serve?** — capacity planning with SLO-aware TTFT and TPOT targets
- **What's the on-prem vs cloud TCO?** — full total cost of ownership with breakeven analysis
- **How do I set up the software stack?** — OS, driver, CUDA, PyTorch, container, and monitoring recommendations

Everything runs in the browser. No backend, no telemetry, no account required.

## Features

### Workload Modes

| Mode | What it calculates |
|---|---|
| **Inference** | Weights + KV cache + overhead, throughput, cost per token |
| **Fine-tune** | Weights + activations + gradients + optimizer (LoRA / QLoRA / full) |
| **Train** | Full pre-training memory with gradient checkpointing |
| **Reverse** | Given a GPU, which models fit? |

### Calculation Engine

All formulas are pure TypeScript functions with no side effects, independently tested with property-based tests (244 tests across 19 test files).

| Component | Formula |
|---|---|
| Weight memory | `num_params × bytes_per_param / 1e9` |
| KV cache | `2 × layers × batch × seq_len × kv_heads × head_dim × bytes / 1e9` |
| Activation memory | `layers × seq × batch × hidden × (34 + 5×seq×heads/hidden) × 2` |
| Optimizer (Adam) | `14 × num_params` bytes |
| Throughput | `bandwidth_GBs / active_weights_GB × efficiency_factor` |
| Cost / 1M tokens | `(hourly_cost / (tok_per_sec × 3600)) × 1_000_000` |

Supports MoE (uses active params for throughput, total for VRAM), GQA, MQA, and MLA (DeepSeek compressed KV cache).

### Precision Options

| Format | Bytes/param |
|---|---|
| FP32 | 4.0 |
| FP16 / BF16 | 2.0 |
| INT8 / FP8 | 1.0 |
| INT4 | 0.5 |
| GGUF Q4\_K\_M | 0.606 |
| GGUF Q5\_K\_M | 0.711 |
| GGUF Q8\_0 | 1.0625 |

KV cache precision is set independently from weight precision.

### Model Database

### Compare Mode

Add up to 3 configurations side-by-side. Numeric deltas are shown relative to the anchor config — green for improvement, red for regression — across VRAM, throughput, cloud cost, and cost per million tokens.

### Reverse Mode

Flip the calculator: pick a GPU (or enter custom VRAM), set a context length and workload mode, and see every model in the database ranked by fit status. Overflow models show the minimum precision required to fit.

### Shareable URLs

The full calculator state (model, precision, KV precision, context, batch, mode, concurrent users, SLO targets) is encoded in the URL. Share a link and the recipient sees exactly the same configuration.

npm run test:watch

# Validate data files against schemas
npm run validate
```

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build

```

---

## Docker

```bash
# Build and run
docker build -t llm-hardware-calculator:latest .

## Data

All data is static JSON bundled with the app. No runtime API calls are made.

- **Models** — sourced from HuggingFace `config.json` files via the ingestion pipeline, with manual overrides for MoE active parameters and MLA compressed dimensions
- **GPUs** — MSRP / street prices, memory bandwidth, FP16 TFLOPS, TDP
- **Cloud** — on-demand and spot pricing with `lastPriceUpdate` timestamps

To update data, edit the JSON files in `src/data/` and run `npm run validate` to check schema compliance.

To re-ingest models from HuggingFace:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/ingest-models.ts
```
